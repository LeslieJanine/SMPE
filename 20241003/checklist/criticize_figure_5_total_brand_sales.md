## Data (4/7)
1. [x] The type of the graphic is adapted to the nature of data (curve, bars, pie, histogram, cloud...);
2. [] Approximations/interpolation make sense;
3. [] Curves are defined by a sufficient number of points;
4. [x] The building method of the curve is clear: interpolation (linear, polynomial,regression...);
5. [x] Confidence intervals are visualized (or given separately);
6. [x] Steps of histograms are adequate;
7. [] Histograms visualize probabilities (from 0 to 1).

## Graphical objects (2/6)
1. [] Graphical objects are readable on screen, on printed version (B/W), on video...;
2. [x] Graphic range is standart, without too similar colors, without green (video);
3. [] Graphical axis are well identified and labelled;
4. [] Scales and units are explicits;
5. [] Curves cross without ambiguity;
6. [x] Grids help the reader.

## Annotations (5/9)
1. [x] Axis are labelled by quantities;
2. [] Labels of the axis are clear, and self contained;
3. [] Units are indicated on the axis;
4. [x] Axes are oriented from the left to the right and from the bottom to the top;
5. [] Origin is (0,0), if not it should be clearly justified;
6. [x] No hole on the axes.
6. [x] For bar graphs/histograms order of bars is based on classical ordering (alphabetical, temporal, from the best to the worse) are better than a random order;
7. [x] Each curve has a legend;
8. [] Each bar has a legend;

## Information (4/7)
1. [x] Curves are on the same scale;
2. [x] The number of curves on a same graph is small (less than 6); 
3. [x] Compare curves on a same graphic;
4. [x] A curve cannot be removed without reducing the information; 
5. [] The graphic gives a relevant information to the reader;
6. [] If the vertical axis shows averages, it should indicates error bars;
7. [] It is not possible to remove any objet without modifying the readability of the graphic.

## Context (1/6)
1. [] All the symbols are defined and referenced in the text;
2. [] The graphic produces more information than any other representation (choice of the variable);
3. [x] The graphic has a title ;
4. [] The title is sufficiently self contained to partially understand the graphic;
5. [] The graphic is referenced in the text;
6. [] The text comment the figure.

## The graphical representation is not elegant
