# Popper’s text summary

The author shares a report on his work in the philosophy of science, exploring criteria determining when a theory can be considered scientific, focusing on distinguishing science from pseudoscience. He begins by explaining the origins of his work, which stemmed from scepticism about the scientific status claimed by three theories—Marxist theory of history, psychoanalysis, and individual psychology—highlighting their differences from physical theories. He excludes judgments of truth, the biases of rigorous physical-mathematical accuracy, or issues of measurement, and notes with frustration an "incessant stream of confirmations," or observations that appear to provide these theories with certain verification in the eyes of their admirers.

Using considerations made about Einstein's gravitational theory, he illustrates how these observations guided the formulation of conclusions to establish that the criterion of scientific status for a theory is its falsifiability, refutability, or testability.

According to this criterion, he rejects astrology, Marxist theory of history, and psychoanalytic theories for failing to meet it, though he emphasizes not doubting that much of what they say is of considerable importance.

He concludes that the problem he tried to solve by proposing the criterion of falsifiability was called the 'problem of demarcation' noting that for statements or systems of statements to be ranked as scientific, they must be capable of conflicting with possible or conceivable observations.
